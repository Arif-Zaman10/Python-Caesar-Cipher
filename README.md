🔐 Caesar Cipher: 
This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques. It allows you to encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt) messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet.


📜 How it Works:
-You choose whether to encode or decode.
-Enter your message.
-Enter a shift number (how many letters you want to move in the alphabet).
-The program shifts only the letters while leaving spaces, numbers, and symbols unchanged.
-You can run the program as many times as you like until you type n to quit.


▶️ Example run: 
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world!
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi!
Type 'y' if you want to continue, or type 'n' if you do not want to:
n
GOODBYE 👋


📝 Notes:
-Only letters a-z are shifted.
-Numbers, spaces, and symbols stay the same.
-Shift numbers larger than 26 are automatically wrapped (e.g., shift=30 works like shift=4).
-The program will keep running until you choose to exit.
